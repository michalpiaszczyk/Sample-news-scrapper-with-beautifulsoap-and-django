**1. Purpose **

The purpose of the code is tracking of news appearing on selected websites. These are mainly government websites and websites of agencies responsible for the implementation of European funds in Poland. Most of them do not support accessible channels for tracking news appearing on them (e.g. RSS feeds). After starting the Django server, it retrieves the content of the websites, downloads news from them and presents them in a readable way.

This is an example and of course you can add other websites using this code.
